Default diagnostics Pagelet used by the diagnostics and 500 Pagelet.
This Pagelet is responsible for displaying additional diagnostics. By
default the diagnostics Pagelet is provided with [BigPipe]. However, if you
need a custom diagnostics you can extend this Pagelet. For example to change
the default view.

## Installation

The diagnostics Pagelet is distributed through the node package manager (npm).

```
npm install --save diagnostics-pagelet
```

## Support

Got stuck? Or can't wrap your head around a concept or just want some feedback,
we got a dedicated IRC channel for that on Freenode:

- **IRC Server**: `irc.freenode.net`
- **IRC Room**: `#bigpipe`

Still stuck? Create an issue. Every question you have is a bug in our
documentation and that should be corrected. So please, don't hesitate to create
issues, many of them.

### Example

In this example the diagnostics Pagelet is extended with a custom view.
[BigPipe] will automatically discover this extended version
if it is provided to [BigPipe] alongside the other pagelets.
Note that the enviroment variable can be overruled to manage the
data that is displayed.

```js
'use strict';

//
// Extend the diagnostics Pagelet with a custom view.
//
var Diagnostics = require('diagnostics-pagelet').extend({
  view: '/path/to/my/custom-view.html'
});

//
// Initialise BigPipe server.
//
var pipe = require('bigpipe').createServer(2000, {
  pagelets: [ Diagnostics, ... ]
});
```

## Debugging

The library makes use the `diagnostics` module from Pagelet.
To display the diagnostics Pagelet specific debug messages, supply the
following before running the program or

```bash
DEBUG=pagelet:diagnostics node ...
```

## Testing

Tests are automatically run on [Travis CI] to ensure that everything is
functioning as intended. For local development we automatically install a
[pre-commit] hook that runs the `npm test` command every time you commit changes.
This ensures that we don't push any broken code in to this project.

To run tests locally, make sure the development dependencies are installed.

```bash
npm test
npm run coverage
```
